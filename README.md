# Spotify Api App 

The goal of this application is to query the spotify api and simply return the top 5 most listened to songs. Add these songs to a database and then save them.

So then I can come back in the future and see what the top songs were for me. 

## Feature Ideas
- query for songs played that day
- store into database
- have a ui to view songs
- some metrics that go to a backend

### Backend
- Get the token for api
- send request to the api
- serialize and deserialize data
- store into a server
- show to the front end when asked

## Frontend
- Button that will cause the endpoint to run and serve the songs played that day
